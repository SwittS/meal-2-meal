##meal-2-meal
This project was completed over the course of five days. The goal of the project was to complete a full RESTful CRUD app that used personal APIs. We were informed to create two databases that would reference a one-to-many relationship or a many-to-many relationship. The functionality of my app is a meal comparison app that can demonstrate the macronutrients of a meal based on the ingredients used. It will display to the user the carbohydrate, fat, and protein content of the full meal.
